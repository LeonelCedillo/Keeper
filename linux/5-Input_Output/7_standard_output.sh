Standard Output
You might not even know it yet, but you're already a pro at using standard output. You've been using it since you started the first exercise in this course.

"Standard Output", usually called "standard out" or "stdout", is the default place where programs print their output. It's just a stream of data that prints to your terminal, but we'll talk later about how it can be redirected to other places.

All programming languages have a simple way to print to stdout. In Python, it's the print function:

print("Hello world")
# Hello world

In a shell, it's the echo command:

echo "Hello world"
# Hello world
