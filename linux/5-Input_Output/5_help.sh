Help

By convention, most production-ready CLI tools have a "help" option 
that prints information about how to use the tool. It's usually 
accessed with one of the following:

--help (flag)
-h (flag)
help (first positional argument)
The "help" output is often easier to parse than a full man page. 
It's usually more of a quick start guide than a full manual.
